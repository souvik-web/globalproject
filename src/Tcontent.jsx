            <p>When I was initially approached by Global Electronic Technology, Inc. (GET) regarding my credit card processing I was a little hesitant. There are so many different credit card processors out there that I wasnâ€™t sure it was something I wanted to invest my time in, but I am glad I did. The level of care and dedication I receive from GET as a whole is much improved from my previous processing company. I was so impressed with the service and savings that I received at my El Segundo dental office that I signed up to have them service my Gardena location too!</p>
